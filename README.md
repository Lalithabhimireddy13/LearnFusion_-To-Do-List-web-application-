# To-Do List Web Application

This is a simple To-Do List web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to manage their daily tasks by adding and removing items from a list.

## Project Setup

### HTML

The HTML file provides the basic structure of the application. It includes a form to input new tasks and an unordered list to display the tasks.

### CSS

The CSS file styles the application to create a clean and modern look. It includes styles for the layout, form, buttons, and task list items.

### JavaScript

The JavaScript file adds interactivity to the application. It handles form submissions to add new tasks to the list and provides functionality to remove tasks when the delete button is clicked.

## How It Works

- **HTML**: Defines the structure of the application with a form for adding tasks and a list for displaying them.
- **CSS**: Applies styling to ensure the application has a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing design.
- **JavaScript**: Implements functionality to:
  - Prevent the form from refreshing the page on submission.
  - Add new tasks to the list.
  - Remove tasks from the list when the delete button is clicked.
